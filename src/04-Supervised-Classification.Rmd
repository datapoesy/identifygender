# Supervised Classification:

Supervised classifcation is possible with help of training data fed to the Learning Machine.  This can be achieved in two ways:  

Availability of data where the identity of the records in the given domain are already labelled  
Employ unsupervised training on a subset of the data which can further be employed to predict the larger dataset  

###Preparing a Minimal training set using clerical means

In the following example, 216 pairs of records are labelled through manual inspection which is further utilized to classify the entire dataset.  

```{r}
#minTrain <- getMinimalTrain(rpairs)

#minTrain <- editMatch(minTrain)
#minTrain <- load(file="minTrain")

#save(minTrain,file="minTrain")

#model <-trainSupv(minTrain, method="bagging")
#save(model,file="model")
#model <- load(file="model")

#result <- classifySupv(model, newdata=rpairs)
#summary(result)
```
