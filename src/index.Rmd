# Executive Summary {-}
\fontsize{12}{22}

Over the years, many organizations acquired duplicate records in slightly different forms.  The variations could be related to very simple phonemic errors or even due to missing information in some of the records.  Customer records are the most frequent culprits in this aspect since they tend to register an alternate account at the first onset of not able to trace any previous registrations.  
  
Consolidating these different records, by pairing up similar records and clearing away duplicate ones is referred to as, Record Linkage.  There are many custom products in the market claiming to achieve this functionality.  At the same time, in practical sense, these tools still needs improvement from an accuracy standpoint and this analysis is expected to provide additional insight into the problem and solution by going a little into the basics and attempting solutions from the latest learnings in the field.  
  
This research attempts to solve the problem simulated data.  The whole approach is documented for the purpose of reproducibility and future enhancement.  This study is more of an exploratory attempt to solve the Record Linkage problem from the Customer Records perspective than a scientific research towards any pre-defined hypothesis.
