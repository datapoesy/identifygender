# Introduction {#introduction}

Within the growth span of any organization, multiple systems get harnessed into the IT landscape.  Each of these systems tend to keep a version of the organizational data giving rise to concerns about its authenticity.  For any information, there should only be a single version of truth; at the same time, this remains in stark contrast with the organic, haphzard manner in which organizations grow.  

In this analysis while we look at customer records from a linkage context, the concept and solution is applicable to a wide scenario and range of problems.  

##Objective

The objective of this controlled experiment is to:  

*  Set up a reproducible controlled experiment
*  Test alternate deduplication solutions employing clerical, Machine Learning or Hybrid approaches  
*  Validate the output by comparing the input to the output  
*  Report the accuracy of the solution in quantitative terms   

##Experiment Framework:

The experiment framework is illustrated in the image that follows:

##Limitations:

The solution presented herein is based on simulated data.  The efficiency of the solution depends on the extent to which the dataset can be made to reflect the poor quality of the input data.  

While the solution is defined, interpreted and solved in R, from a usability perspective, this would need to be converted to an implementation which needs to be considered out of the scope of this exercise.
